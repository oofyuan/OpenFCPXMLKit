## [3.3.12](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.12) - 2026-08-24

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Suite:** **1254** listed (`swift test list` — **1240** + **10** + **4**), including Inspector-unit contract tests (`FCPXMLInspectorDisplayUnitsTests`) and Duplicate Frames source-range overlap tests (`FCPXMLRoleInventoryDuplicateFramesTests`).
- **Inspector unit contract:** Video & Audio Effects / Role Inventory **Effects** Settings are locked to Final Cut Pro Inspector units (Position px from sequence height, Scale %, Rotation degrees, Opacity %, Blend Mode labels). Filter `param` Position (Draw Mask) is not converted. Sign `effect-settings-match-fcp-display`.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 14 / 20 (Inspector units table; Duplicate Frames = Source In/Out overlap), Coverage, ARCHITECTURE, AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS Signs `effect-settings-match-fcp-display` (unit table, sequence-height formula, Draw Mask pass-through, `FCPXMLInspectorDisplayUnitsTests`) and `duplicate-frames-match-source-in-out`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Transform Position Inspector pixels:** Video & Audio Effects and Role Inventory **Effects** now convert FCPXML `adjust-transform` position from sequence-height percentages into Final Cut Pro Inspector pixels (`xml × sequenceHeight / 100` on both axes). A 2048×930 timeline that stored `-8.84241 -14.0753` was previously reported as `-8.8 px, -14.1 px`; it now matches the Inspector (`-82.2 px, -130.9 px`). Conversion uses the containing `<sequence>` format, not the clip’s own format. Sign `effect-settings-match-fcp-display`.
- **Duplicate Frames source overlap:** Role Inventory **Duplicate Frames** intersects each clip’s **Source In** + **Source Duration** with other inventoried usages of the same media resource. Retimed clips no longer inherit the whole `timeMap` as overlap (false multi-minute duplicates when Source In/Out did not overlap). Same-clip video/audio rows are not self-duplicates. Sign `duplicate-frames-match-source-in-out`.

---

## [3.3.11](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.11) - 2026-08-22

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Suite:** **1244** listed (`swift test list` — **1230** + **10** + **4**), including expanded `FCPXMLRoleInventoryClipCollectorTests` and `FCPXMLRoleInheritanceMatrixTests` (secondary-storyline host-role isolation; unfolded multicam interiors omitted from Role Inventory).
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 02 / 11 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 00-Index, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Parsing roles + mermaid), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Sign `secondary-storyline-clips-keep-own-roles`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Secondary storyline inherited parent roles:** Connected clips inside a nested `<spine>` no longer inherit the parent storyline clip’s video role. Only clips that actually carry that role (or FCP’s default **Video** when unassigned) appear on that role’s sheet. Sign `secondary-storyline-clips-keep-own-roles`.
- **Unfolded multicam interiors on Role Inventory:** Angle clips inside a timeline `mc-clip` are no longer listed as their own inventory rows with intra-multicam timecodes; the `mc-clip` host remains the inventoried clip. Host audio-component rows still use the active audio angle for Source File Name (`preferAudioAngle`). Sign `secondary-storyline-clips-keep-own-roles`.

---

## [3.3.10](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.10) - 2026-08-21

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Large-project reporting performance:** Reports on very large FCPXML (tens of MB, thousands of clips) no longer stall during **Loading Roles** / **Projecting Timeline**. FCPXML time strings (`N/Ds`, `Ns`) parse without `NSRegularExpression`; `conform-rate` scaling resolution is memoised per element for the duration of a read-only walk (`FinalCutPro.FCPXML.withTimingCache(_:)`); resource lookups by `id` are O(1) via `OFKXMLElement.firstChildElement(withID:)` / `firstChildElement(named:)`; and Projection and Extraction skip dense annotation leaves through `FCPXMLElementType.isLeafAnnotation` and `fcpProjectableStoryElements`.
- **Host annotations follow enabled sheets:** Projection already had `includeMarkerAnnotations` / `includeKeywordAnnotations`. Report builds now pass the existing `includeMarkers` / `includeKeywords` (CLI `--report-markers` / `--report-keywords`) into `TimelineProjectionOptions.forReport(...)`, so a Role-Inventory-only export does not collect thousands of host keywords. No new flag.
- **Memory headroom on 8 GB machines:** Workbook writing moves to XLKit **1.1.8** (streaming worksheet XML, interned cell formats), PDF export streams pages instead of buffering the whole document, and Projection / PDF hot loops drain temporaries with `autoreleasepool`. Full Excel + PDF exports of FCPXML files larger than 25 MB now complete without the process being killed.
- **Suite:** **1241** listed (`swift test list` — **1227** + **10** + **4**), including the new `FCPXMLLeafAnnotationWalkTests` (annotation-leaf skipping, dense-keyword hang budget, id lookup) plus expanded `FCPXMLSpeedChangeEffectsReportTests` and `FCPXMLTimelineProjectionTests`.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 02 / 03 / 11–12 / 19–20 / 00-Index / Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Parsing timing cache + TimeStringParsing, Projection annotation options + container `contentBound`, Reporting `RoleInventorySourceSpan`, Mermaid), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Signs `speed-change-row-per-timeline-usage`, `speed-percent-is-media-over-timeline`, `retimed-source-duration-follows-speed`, `retime-roles-default-like-effects`, `containers-bound-their-content-not-their-anchors`, `timing-cache-is-read-only-scoped`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Speed Change Effects missing clips:** Every retimed timeline usage now gets its own row. Repeated uses of one source clip were previously collapsed into a single row (59 retimed clips in Final Cut Pro reported as 48), because projection windows were grouped by source rather than by contiguous timeline usage. Rows are keyed by clip name + Timeline In. Sign `speed-change-row-per-timeline-usage`.
- **Speed Change Effects speed values:** Speed percent is a timeline-weighted average of the segment scales within a single usage (media span ÷ timeline span), so freeze/hold segments count as occupied timeline and direction changes use absolute media spans. Values no longer blend unrelated usages of the same source. Sign `speed-percent-is-media-over-timeline`.
- **Retimed Source Out / Clip Duration:** Role Inventory Source columns for a retimed clip report the source span the clip actually consumes (a 50 % retime of an 8 s 20 f timeline clip reads 4 s 10 f) instead of repeating the timeline duration. No new columns. Sign `retimed-source-duration-follows-speed`.
- **Speed Change Effects roles:** Retimed rows resolve Role ▸ Subrole the same way the Video & Audio Effects sheet does, so a host without an explicit `videoRole` / `audioRole` shows the same default the Role Inventory shows (**Video**, or **Dialogue** for audio-only hosts) instead of a blank cell. `--exclude-role` / `excludedRoles` now filters those rows too. Sign `retime-roles-default-like-effects`.
- **Audio Clip Duration read whole source:** A `<clip>` / `<sync-clip>` shell that omits `start` now bounds its contained (lane-less) children to its own visible span during projection, so Clip Duration and the Source/Timeline columns report the portion used on the timeline rather than the full source length. Connected clips (with a `lane`) keep their own extent. Sign `containers-bound-their-content-not-their-anchors`.

## [3.3.9](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.9) - 2026-08-20

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Suite:** **1228** listed (`swift test list` — **1214** + **10** + **4**), including `FCPXMLReportRoleExclusionTests` coverage for Excel-truncated sheet-tab exclusion.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19–20 / 00-Index / Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE, AGENT, `.cursorrules`, GUARDRAILS (Sign `excluded-roles-apply-to-all-sheets` sheet-tab matching), and CLI README.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`--exclude-role` / Excel-truncated sheet tabs:** Excluding a per-role inventory sheet tab (Excel’s 31-character limit via `sheetTabName`) now also omits matching Role ▸ Subrole rows on Role Inventory, Titles & Generators, Video & Audio Effects, and other role-bearing sheets. Previously the truncated tab could remove the sheet while full-length Role ▸ Subrole cells remained. Sign `excluded-roles-apply-to-all-sheets`.

---

## [3.3.8](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.8) - 2026-08-20

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Report Out = last visible frame:** Timeline Out and Source Out on Excel/PDF reports now show the last included/visible frame (Final Cut Pro / Resolve Mark Out style) via `ReportFormatting.outTimecodeString(fromExclusiveEnd:)`. Duration columns are unchanged. Projection / FCPXML spans remain half-open internally. Sign `report-out-is-last-visible-frame`. Manual 12 / 20.
- **Suite:** **1227** listed (`swift test list` — **1213** + **10** + **4**), including expanded `FCPXMLReportFormattingTests` (Out last-visible-frame) and `FCPXMLReportRoleExclusionTests` (full Role ▸ Subrole / raw FCP id / sibling Effects).
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 12 / 19–20 / 00-Index / Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, SECURITY, ARCHITECTURE, AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Sign `report-out-is-last-visible-frame`; strengthened `excluded-roles-apply-to-all-sheets`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`--exclude-role` / full Role ▸ Subrole vs Effects:** Excluding an inventory sheet name such as `Vfx Shot No ▸ Vfx Shot No-1` now omits matching Video & Audio Effects rows. Title effect Role ▸ Subrole uses the full inventory-style display; exclusion also matches bare main-role Effects fields and raw FCP `Main.Sub` ids. Sign `excluded-roles-apply-to-all-sheets`.

---

## [3.3.7](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.7) - 2026-08-18

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Suite:** **1222** listed (`swift test list` — **1208** + **10** + **4**), including expanded `FCPXMLReportRoleExclusionTests`, `FCPXMLEffectsCollectorTests`, `FCPXMLTransformAdjustmentParsingTests`, `FCPXMLReportFormattingTests`, `FCPXMLSpeedChangeFormattingTests`, and `FCPXMLTitleDisplayTests`.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 11 / 14 / 19–20 / 22, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid Support/`ReportRoleExclusion`; Model `componentSamples` / Title display), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Signs `excluded-roles-apply-to-all-sheets`, `effect-settings-match-fcp-display`, `title-text-same-line-runs-concatenate`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`--exclude-role` applies to every role-bearing sheet:** Excluding a role (for example `VFX Shot No`) now omits matching rows from Markers, Keywords, Titles & Generators, Video & Audio Effects, Speed Change Effects, and Summary role durations, not only Role Inventory. Empty Role ▸ Subrole fields stay. Transitions, Non-Std Effects & Templates, and Media Summary are unchanged. Sign `excluded-roles-apply-to-all-sheets`.
- **Effect settings match Final Cut Pro display:** `adjust-blend` opacity is shown as percent (`0.3987` → `Opacity 39.9%`). Transform reports non-default Position / Rotation / Scale from attributes and nested `param` keyframes (identity rows omitted; non-uniform scale as X/Y), including spine `<clip>` / `<video>` wrappers. Video filters report inspector `param` values (Color Adjustments Exposure / Brightness, Draw Mask Position) and omit Motion blobs. Role Inventory **Effects** uses the same formatted values. Sign `effect-settings-match-fcp-display`.
- **Speed Change Optical Flow name:** `timeMap frameSampling="optical-flow"` reports **Optical Flow Retime** (percent stays in Settings). Default sampling remains **Retime**. Sign `speed-change-merge-extraction-when-projection-incomplete`.
- **Titles & Generators Title Text:** Adjacent `text-style` runs in one `<text>` concatenate as Final Cut Pro shows them (`1501` + `0` → `15010`). The ` | ` separator is only used between separate `<text>` children (paragraphs). Duplicate identical Font specs collapse. Sign `title-text-same-line-runs-concatenate`.

---

## [3.3.6](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.6) - 2026-08-15

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Role Inventory screenshots use FCP proxy as fallback:** `--include-role-inventory-screenshots` / `includeScreenshotsInRoleInventory` always grabs Source In from `original-media` when that file exists and can be decoded. `proxy-media` is used only when the original is missing or unreadable (for example MXF or camera RAW). Source File Path stays original-first. PDF still omits the column. Sign `role-inventory-screenshots-prefer-original`.
- **Kind-aware media URLs:** `fcpMediaURL(kind:)` and `fcpMediaRepresentationURLs` resolve original and proxy from the same unfolded leaf (mc-clip / sync / ref-clip / audition).
- **Suite:** **1203** listed (`swift test list` — **1189** + **10** + **4**), including `FCPXMLRoleInventoryScreenshotMediaTests` and kind-aware `FCPXMLMediaURLResolutionTests`.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 11 / 15 / 19–20, Coverage, Tests READMEs (including ExcelReportTest Output), ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid Support/Excel screenshot types; Parsing `fcpMediaRepresentationURLs`), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS Sign `role-inventory-screenshots-prefer-original`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CLI:** `--include-role-inventory-screenshots` is now treated as a report modifier and requires `--report`.

---

## [3.3.5](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.5) - 2026-08-14

### ✨ New Features

- **Role Inventory screenshots (Excel):** Optional `ReportOptions.includeScreenshotsInRoleInventory` / CLI `--include-role-inventory-screenshots` inserts a **Screenshot** column after **Row** on Selected Roles Inventory and every per-role sheet, embedding a **Source In** frame grab via XLKit (aspect-preserving; **480px** max long edge). PDF omits the column. Missing media → blank cell. Not a `ReportColumn` / `--exclude-column` target.
- **Four-row report cover branding:** Excel cover is **A1** Created-by, **A2** `Created on yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss`, **A3** `Visit <url>`, **A4** optional `copyrightLabel`. PDF cover matches that stack. Customize Visit via `ReportWorkbookCoverSheet.visitURL` (API / GUI only; default OpenFCPXMLKit GitHub).
- **Role Inventory Speed Change Settings:** Optional `includeSpeedChangeSettingsInRoleInventory` / `--include-role-inventory-speed-change-settings` adds a retime-percent column after **Effects** (not a `ReportColumn`).

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Source File Name for nested shapes:** Media URL / Source File Name resolution walks multicam, sync-clip, compound, ref-clip, and audition leaves so inventory rows populate nested media paths when available.
- **Unrole’d primary Video inventory:** Primary-spine video-only clips without `videoRole` invent as **Video** (no longer dropped from inventory).
- **ExcelReportTest:** Writes `Output/OFK-Screenshots.xlsx` for screenshot-column review; suite **1193** listed (**1179** + **10** + **4**).
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19–20 / 00-Index, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README (TOC + SPM `3.3.5`), ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid ExcelReportTest **10** / OpenFCPXMLKitTests **1179**; cover + screenshot map), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Signs `role-inventory-screenshots-excel-only`, `report-cover-four-row-branding`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Host roles vs connected titles:** Spine / host Role Inventory no longer inherits connected `<title>` roles (e.g. Vfx), so video hosts stay on Video and titles keep Vfx (Sign `host-roles-exclude-connected-titles`).
- **Speed Change Effects completeness:** When Projection emits some retimes, Extraction-only optical-flow / wrapper retimes are merged; nested `timeMap` leaves under a retimed ancestor are skipped (Sign `speed-change-merge-extraction-when-projection-incomplete`).

---

## [3.3.4](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.4) - 2026-08-06

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Shot Extraction Notion JSON key order:** Notion (`.json`) manifests emit object keys in the same order as the CSV Shot Data columns (`ShotManifestSchema.columns`), and keep the shot array in Shot ID / timeline order. Previously `JSONSerialization` + `.sortedKeys` alphabetised keys.
- **ShotExtractionTest:** Optional Swift Testing integration target (**4** `@Test`) mirroring `ExcelReportTest` — local stills fixture → PNG + CSV / Notion JSON under `Tests/ShotExtractionTest/Output/` (`OFK-Shots.csv` / `.json` aliases); cancels without fixture or when media is missing.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19 / 21, Coverage, Documentation README, Tests READMEs (incl. Submitted FCPXML), README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid `ShotExtractionTest` **4**), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS refreshed for Notion CSV-parity key order and the new integration target. Suite counts **1173** listed (**1161** + **8** + **4**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

---

## [3.3.3](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.3) - 2026-07-28

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Row colour from semantic facts:** Excel and PDF colour inventory / section rows from typed models (`roleSubrole`, `category`, Non-Std Kind/UID, marker type) via `FCPXMLReportRowColorPolicy.fontColorHex(roleSubrole:categoryLabel:context:)` / `fontColorHex(forNonStandardKind:uid:)`, not from filtered header cells. Excluding Role ▸ Subrole, Category, or Kind no longer drops row colouring.
- **`--exclude-column` Role aliases:** Accepts shell-friendly `Role > Subrole`, `Roles > Subrole`, and `Roles ▸ Subrole` (normalises ` > ` → ` ▸ `) in addition to `Role ▸ Subrole` / `Role Subrole`.
- **ExcelReportTest:** Writes `Output/OFK-ExcludeRoleSubrole.xlsx` / `.pdf` for Role ▸ Subrole exclusion regression. `Package.swift` excludes `Output/` from the ExcelReportTest target (avoids SPM treating local `Sample.fcpxmld` as sources).
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19–20, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid ExcelReportTest **8**), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Sign `row-colour-survives-column-exclusion`) refreshed. Suite counts **1169** listed (**1161** + **8**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Empty per-role inventory sheets when Role ▸ Subrole excluded:** Excel per-role sheets previously wrote cell values only through the colour path, which looked up the Role ▸ Subrole header in filtered headers; excluding that column returned nil colour and left sheets empty (Selected Roles Inventory stayed populated). Excel now always writes cell values; colour is applied independently from the row model. PDF was already drawing rows and stays aligned via the same semantic colour APIs.

---

## [3.3.2](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.2) - 2026-07-28

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19–20, Coverage, Tests READMEs, ARCHITECTURE, AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS refreshed for universal **Row** on all tabular sheets. Suite counts **1165** listed (**1158** + **7**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Non-Std Effects & Templates Row column:** Excel now injects the universal 1-based **Row** column on Non-Std Effects & Templates (same as Markers, Keywords, Effects, and other tabular sheets) via `filteredTabularSection` / `ensuringRowColumn`. PDF already injected Row; it now also honours `--exclude-column Row` for that sheet. Empty **No Non-Std Effects Found** status lands in **B2**.

---

## [3.3.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.1) - 2026-07-28

### ✨ New Features

- **Shot Extraction dry-run:** `ShotExtractor.plan(from:options:)` / `planShots(options:)` validates the timeline and returns ``ShotExtractionPlan`` (`shotCount`, planned folder, shot rows) without writing PNGs or manifests. CLI `--extract-shots --dry-run` (output-dir optional; optional `--result-file-path` writes a dry-run JSON summary). Designed for future GUI open/drop preflight. Invalid timelines throw ``ShotExtractionError`` with `LocalizedError` messages the GUI can display.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Empty report sheet status rows:** When a section is enabled (full report or a single sheet) but has no data, Excel and PDF keep the sheet headers and show a status row — **No Markers Found**, **No Keywords Found**, **No Titles & Generators Found**, **No Transitions Found**, **No Effects Found**, **No Speed Change Effects Found**, **No Non-Std Effects Found**, **No Roles Found** (Selected Roles Inventory), matching Media Summary’s **No Missing Media**. Shared via `ReportEmptySectionStatus`; PDF sheet plan includes empty enabled sections. Per-role inventory tabs still omit when empty. Summary layout unchanged.
- **Shot Extraction primary-spine rules:** Reject titles / generators / Motion templates (`containsTitlesOrGenerators`) and primary audio clips (`containsPrimaryAudio`) in addition to non-still video. Connected lanes remain ignored. `extract` and `plan` share one validation path.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19–22, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid ShotExtraction / CLI), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS refreshed for dry-run, empty-sheet status rows, and expanded rejection rules. Suite counts **1166** listed (**1159** + **7**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

## [3.3.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.3.0) - 2026-07-27

### ✨ New Features

- **Shot Extraction:** Primary-timeline still-image shots → PNG dataset + CSV or Notion JSON manifest (`ShotExtractor` / `extractShots(options:)`). Rejects timelines with video media; reuses stills as distinct Shot IDs (`{scene}-001` …); CLI `--extract-shots` with required `--scene-number`, `--extract-format csv|notion`, `--folder-format`, `--result-file-path`, optional `--icon` (emoji/text for **Icon Image** column before **Image Filename**). Notion JSON follows the [csv2notion-neo](https://github.com/TheAcharya/csv2notion-neo) JSON import convention (array of column-keyed objects). Folder naming: `{timeline}-{yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss}` (e.g. `Demo_V1-2026-07-27-09-14-21`). Depends on [swift-textfile](https://github.com/orchetect/swift-textfile).

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Media Summary empty state:** When Media Summary is enabled and no referenced media is missing, Excel and PDF keep the sheet headers and show a **No Missing Media** status row in the path column (**B2** with **Row**; default body colour, not missing-path red). Distinguish Original/Proxy mode places the status under **Missing Original**. Shared via `MediaSummaryReportSection.exportTable()` so both exporters stay identical.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual reordered (**21** Shot Extraction, **22** Examples); CLI Manual / agent guides / ARCHITECTURE mermaids; suite counts **1158** listed (**1151** + **7**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

---

## [3.2.5](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.2.5) - 2026-07-24

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Title Role ▸ Subrole honesty:** `ReportFormatting.titleRoleSubrole` (Extraction and Projection host roles) surfaces the title element’s video `role` attribute for Titles & Generators, Role Inventory, Markers (main role), and Effects (main role). Omitting `role` still defaults to **Titles**. Custom library roles use inventory casing (all-caps acronym-style main roles preserved).
- **Under-spine leaf video / generators:** Role Inventory no longer skips negative-lane leaf `<video>` / generators via `shouldSkipLeafMedia` (negative-lane leaf `<audio>` still folds into host channel/sync sources). Parsing / Extraction / Projection already exposed these facts; Reporting presentation was the gap.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 20, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid counts), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Sign `title-roles-honor-attribute`) refreshed. Suite counts **1147** listed (**1140** + **7**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Connected titles under the primary storyline:** Titles (and their Markers) connected on negative lanes with custom video roles were inventoried and exported under a hard-coded **Titles** label, so per-role sheets and Role ▸ Subrole columns dropped project-specific roles. Role Inventory, Titles & Generators, Markers, and Effects now honour `Title.role` / Projection host roles.

---

## [3.2.4](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.2.4) - 2026-07-23

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Connected Role Inventory host selection:** Unified `fcpHasStandaloneConnectedInventoryAssignment()` (active `audio-channel-source`, asset-clip `audioRole` / `videoRole`, or first-gen `audio`/`video` child `role`) shared by nested-host escape and fully-occluded retention. GUARDRAILS Sign `connected-role-inventory-survives-nesting`.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 12 / 20, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (where-to-put + Mermaid counts), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS refreshed. Suite counts **1144** listed (**1137** + **7**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Nested connected Role Inventory:** Negative-lane connected hosts with clip-level `audioRole` / `videoRole` (or first-gen child `role`) were folded into the parent when they lacked active `audio-channel-source` elements, so Effects (and similar) roles disappeared from Role Inventory even though Projection windows were correct. The same gap dropped fully occluded hosts that only carried clip-level roles. Both paths now retain those hosts via the shared assignment helper.

---

## [3.2.3](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.2.3) - 2026-07-22

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Summary visual-section subtotal styling (Excel + PDF):** Black fill with bold white **body-size** text (not header 14pt / centred); Excel spans A–E; PDF fills the full table width; no blank separator row. Driven by `SummaryRoleDurationRow.isSectionSubtotal`.
- **Summary title banner:** Excel paints **A1** / **C1–E1** (with **B1** title) and role-table **E3** black so the header band matches metrics width.
- **Effects role preference type-filtering:** `RoleDisplayPreference.preferredRole` filters video/caption vs audio for effects contexts; `.builtIn` priorities use FCP default main-role names only; Video/Dialogue defaults when typed role missing.
- **Non-Std Effects & Templates row colours:** Kind/UID-based colours via `FCPXMLReportRowColorPolicy.bucket(forNonStandardKind:uid:)` (Title purple, Transition gray, Generator blue, Effect green when audio UID else blue).
- **ExcelReportTest `OFK-Full.pdf`:** `exportFullReportPDF` writes the full-report PDF beside `OFK-Full.xlsx`.
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 20, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid + Reporting map), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Signs: `effects-role-type-filter`, `summary-percent-is-fraction`) refreshed. Suite counts **1137** listed (**1130** + **7**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Summary `% of Total` PDF vs Excel:** PDF dumped raw `String(percentOfTotal)` fractions; now uses `formattedPercentOfTotal` to match Excel’s `0.0%` display (e.g. `3.896…` → `389.6%`).

---

## [3.2.2](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.2.2) - 2026-07-22

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Markers sheet includes chapter markers by default:** `includeChapterMarkersInMarkersReport` now defaults to `true` (including `.markersOnly` and selective `--report-markers`). Type = Chapter; omit via API `false` or filter in Excel. Manual 20 / CLI / Coverage / agent docs updated.
- **Markers/Keywords Projection hardening:** When Projection clip annotations exist but filtering yields zero report rows (e.g. formatting failure), Markers and Keywords builders fall back to Extraction. Keyword annotations clamp source ranges to the host media in-point so `start="0s"` keywords on clips with a later media `start` remain visible. Occluded hosts still emit **markers/keywords** (connected clips) while Titles / Transitions / Effects stay gated to visible occupancy. Test counts: **1128** listed (**1122** + **6**).
- **Documentation sync:** Manual 10–12 / 17 / 19–21, Coverage, Documentation hub, Tests READMEs, CLI README, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid + Projection/Reporting map), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS (Signs: `chapter-markers-on-markers-sheet`, `markers-keywords-survive-host-occlusion`) refreshed for chapter-marker default, Markers/Keywords host/occlusion policy, and suite counts **1128** (**1122** + **6**).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Markers/Keywords on `mc-clip` / `ref-clip`:** Timeline Projection now emits host-level clip annotations for multicam and compound clips (markers/keywords on the clip element itself were previously skipped). Sequences that omit `tcFormat` default to NDF when resolving frame rate for absolute times, so Projection report formatting no longer blanks Positions / Timeline In. Regression: `FCPXMLMarkersKeywordsProjectionTests` (inline mc-clip fixture + MulticamSample).
- **Connected-clip markers:** Markers on fully occluded connected / nested hosts now appear on the Markers sheet (and via Markers Extraction). Outside-media-range “Hidden” markers remain opt-in via `includeMarkersOutsideClipBoundaries` / `--include-markers-outside-clip-boundaries`.

## [3.2.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.2.1) - 2026-07-20

### ✨ New Features

- **Per-role inventory Total footer:** Non-empty per-role sheets end with a blank row, then a **Total:** label under Timeline Out and an optimistic sum of that sheet’s Clip Duration values (black/white header styling). Selected Roles Inventory has no Total footer. Omitted when Timeline Out or Clip Duration is excluded. Presentation-thin (`RoleInventorySheetTotal`); not overlap-aware (Summary’s `summaryOverlapAwareDurations` stays Summary-only). Excel and PDF.
- **Duplicate Frames column:** Fixed inventory column after Source Duration. Shows source-range reuse duration for the same media resource (Projection windows); blank when none. `ReportColumn.duplicateFrames` / CLI `--exclude-column "Duplicate Frames"`. Tests: `FCPXMLRoleInventoryDuplicateFramesTests`.
- **Friendlier inventory fixed columns:** Frame Size / Audio Config (video `W × H`; audio Mono/Stereo/channels); **Codecs** and **Ingest Date** promoted from metadata keys (no longer duplicated in the dynamic metadata block). Fixed block is now **26** columns after Row. Tests: `FCPXMLRoleInventoryColumnLayoutTests`.
- **Non-Std Effects & Templates sheet:** Optional section (included in `.full`) listing non-Apple `<effect>` resources; missing Motion template paths flagged `MISSING`. Columns: Name, Kind, Status, Path, UID (no injected Row). Sheet tab shortened for Excel’s 31-character limit. Empty inventories omit the sheet at export. `ReportOptions.includeNonStandardEffectsTemplates` / `.nonStandardEffectsTemplatesOnly` / CLI `--report-non-standard-effects`. Placed before Video & Audio Effects in build / workbook order. Tests: `FCPXMLNonStandardEffectsTemplatesReportTests`.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Documentation sync:** Manual 19–21, Coverage, Tests READMEs, README, CLI README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid + Reporting map), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS updated for Total footers, Duplicate Frames, friendlier columns, Non-Std Effects & Templates, and Row exception on that sheet. Test counts refreshed to **1124** listed in `swift test list` (**1118** OpenFCPXMLKitTests + **6** ExcelReportTest).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **iOS build:** Non-Std Effects & Templates path resolution no longer uses macOS-only `FileManager.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser`. Tilde (`~/…`) template paths now expand via `NSString.expandingTildeInPath` so the library builds for iOS.

---

## [3.2.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.2.0) - 2026-07-19

### ✨ New Features

- **Detached Authoring:** New `FinalCutPro.FCPXML.Authoring` value-graph layer for composing FCPXML without live XML ownership. `Authoring.Document` encode (`makeXMLDocument` / `xmlString`) and limited decode; omit-on-write via `VersionAvailability` / `VersionFeatureGate`. Spine items: asset-clip, gap, title, transition, video, audio, caption, sync-clip, ref-clip, mc-clip, audition; resources: format, asset, effect, media (compound sequence + multicam). Parallel to live `Model/` and `Timeline`/`Export/` — do not use inside Reporting. Tests: `FCPXMLAuthoringTests`. Manual: [08 — Detached Authoring](Documentation/Manual/08-Detached-Authoring.md).
- **Version feature gate:** Public `FinalCutPro.FCPXML.VersionFeatureGate` registry of DTD feature introductions (elements/attributes). Shared by Authoring omit-on-write and `FCPXMLVersionConverter` fallback strip lists. Tests: `FCPXMLVersionFeatureGateTests`.
- **Model adjustments:** Typed `CornersAdjustment` (`adjust-corners`) and `PannerAdjustment` (`adjust-panner`) with clip accessors; MatchProperty / smart-collection DTD rule gaps filled (`projection` / `stereoscopic` / `cinematic`, `isSet` / `isNotSet`).
- **Projection time algebra:** `RetimingSegment.clipped` / `composing(parents:children:)`; `TimelineOccupancyIndex` start-sorted binary-search overlap; `TimelineProjectionOptions.trackAnalysis` preset; audioStart-only J/L split handling in projection. Tests: `FCPXMLProjectionEdgeCaseCorpusTests` and related Projection suites.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Manual reorder:** Inserted **08 — Detached Authoring**; subsequent chapters renumbered (**09–21**). Timeline Projection is **12**, CLI **19**, Reporting **20**, Examples **21**. Documentation hub, README, ARCHITECTURE (Mermaid + folder map), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, GUARDRAILS, and Tests READMEs updated.
- **Documentation sync:** Test counts refreshed to **1114** listed in `swift test list` (**1108** OpenFCPXMLKitTests + **6** ExcelReportTest); ARCHITECTURE Mermaid includes Authoring + VersionFeatureGate; Manual 06/12/14 examples updated for feature gate, occupancy/retiming, Corners/Panner; added [Documentation/Coverage.md](Documentation/Coverage.md) (detailed FCPXML layer matrices).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

## [3.1.2](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.1.2) - 2026-07-19

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Swift Testing migration:** The entire test suite is now **Swift Testing** only (`@Suite` / `@Test` / `#expect` / `#require`). There is no remaining `import XCTest` under `Tests/`. Shared harness: `FCPXMLTestSampleLoading` (`tryLoad*`) + `FCPXMLTestingSampleSupport` (`require*`); bundled samples fail if missing; optional fixtures (Submitted inbox, reporting / ExcelReportTest Sample) use `Test.cancel`. Performance smoke uses `ContinuousClock` sanity budgets instead of XCTest `measure`. Suite count unchanged: **1084** listed in `swift test list` (**1078** OpenFCPXMLKitTests + **6** ExcelReportTest). See GUARDRAILS Sign: `swift-testing-only`.
- **Manual reorder:** Manual chapters renumbered to sequential **01–20** — Timeline Projection is **11**, Media Processing **12**, … Cross-Platform **16**, Errors **17**, CLI **18**, Reporting **19**, Examples **20**. Index, Documentation hub, README API links, ARCHITECTURE, AGENT, and `.cursorrules` updated to match.
- **Documentation sync:** GUARDRAILS, ARCHITECTURE (incl. Tests harness Mermaid), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, README, Tests READMEs, and ExcelReportTest / Submitted FCPXML READMEs refreshed for Swift Testing, `swift test list`, and current Manual chapter numbers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.1.1) - 2026-07-18

### ✨ New Features

- **Markers outside clip boundaries:** By default the Markers report omits markers whose `start` is outside the host clip’s media range (hidden in Final Cut Pro’s timeline/Tags). Opt in with `ReportOptions.includeMarkersOutsideClipBoundaries` / CLI `--include-markers-outside-clip-boundaries` to include them and add a **Hidden** column (✓ outside / ✗ inside). The Hidden column is not part of `--exclude-column`. Sample: `HiddenMarkers.fcpxml`. Tests: `FCPXMLMarkersReportTests`, `FCPXMLFileTest_HiddenMarkers`; ExcelReportTest writes `OFK-OutsideClipBoundaries.xlsx` / `.pdf`.
- **Excel sheet protection:** `ReportOptions.protectSheets` / CLI `--protect-sheets` applies worksheet protection to every sheet in the Excel workbook (cover + content). Edit lock only — not file-open encryption; PDF export is unchanged (use Preview → Encrypt for PDF passwords). Tests: `FCPXMLReportExcelExportTests`; ExcelReportTest writes `OFK-ProtectedSheets.xlsx`.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Documentation:** Added [GUARDRAILS.md](GUARDRAILS.md) as a companion to [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — hard must / must-not constraints for contributors and agents (layer boundaries, naming, FCPXML 1.5 floor, reporting honesty, fixtures, Signs for learned locks). Cross-linked from README, Manual index, CONTRIBUTING, AGENT, and `.cursorrules`.
- **Documentation sync:** Test/sample counts and API surface refreshed across README, Manual, Tests READMEs, ARCHITECTURE (incl. Mermaid), AGENT, `.cursorrules`, and GUARDRAILS — **1084** listed tests (**1078** + **6**), **60** public FCPXML samples; documenting `includeMarkersOutsideClipBoundaries` / `--protect-sheets`. Manual chapters **19** / **16** / **17** / **12** / **01** / **20** aligned for `protectSheets`, Markers **Hidden** vs `hidden-clip-marker`, and Excel-only sheet protection.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.1.0) - 2026-07-16


### ✨ New Features

- **Effects → Projection:** Report builder prefers ``WindowReportEffectAnnotation`` collected during timeline Projection via shared ``EffectsCollector`` (filters, volume/implicit volume, transform rows, compositing, spatial conform; video-filter occlusion policy preserved). Extraction remains fallback when Projection has no effect annotations. Tests: `FCPXMLEffectsProjectionTests`.
- **Transitions → Projection:** Report builder prefers ``WindowTransitionAnnotation`` collected during timeline Projection (name, spine placement, Apple-supplied, timing). Extraction remains fallback when Projection has no transition annotations. Tests: `FCPXMLTransitionsProjectionTests`.
- **Titles & Generators → Projection:** Report builder prefers ``WindowTitleAnnotation`` collected during timeline Projection (title/generator story hosts, including titles with no nested story children). Extraction remains fallback when Projection has no title annotations. Tests: `FCPXMLTitlesProjectionTests`.
- **Markers + Keywords → Projection:** Report builders prefer ``ProjectedClipAnnotations`` collected during timeline Projection (covers title-hosted markers such as BasicMarkers). Extraction remains fallback when Projection has no marker/keyword annotations. Tests: `FCPXMLMarkersKeywordsProjectionTests`.
- **Timeline Projection:** New `Projection/` mid-layer between Extraction and Reporting. `TimelineProjecting` / `TimelineProjector` emit Sendable `MediaUsageWindow` values (per `MediaChannel`, `LanePath`, `RetimingSegment`) for visible usages with identity or `timeMap` retiming (normalized segments, reverse detection, multi-segment windows); `ConformRate` scale via shared `fcpConformRateScalingFactor`. Recursive story walk for nested spines and anchored children (`SpineProjection`, `ProjectionTiming`); J/L cuts via `AudioSplitRetiming`. Unfolds `mc-clip` angles (`MulticamProjection`), `ref-clip` media sequences (`RefClipProjection`), auditions, and `video`/`audio` leaves with `ChannelKindFilter` / `srcEnable`. Role Inventory, Speed Change, Media Summary, Effects, and Summary consume shared `ReportProjectionContext` windows (projected once per timeline); Speed Change prefers non-identity `RetimingSegment` facts; Role Inventory overlays timeline bounds from matching windows; Media Summary prefers window media URLs; Summary uses projection-backed spans; `TimelineOccupancyIndex` for overlap queries. Extraction remains the source for roles/metadata discovery where annotations are absent.
- **Reporting contracts:** Per-sheet obligation contracts (Manual 20); `ReportMediaResolutionPolicy` (`.failSoft` / `.failLoud`) with CLI `--media-resolution`; Media Summary optional Missing Original / Missing Proxy columns (`mediaSummaryDistinguishProxyAndOriginal`, `--media-summary-distinguish-proxy`). Tests: `FCPXMLReportObligationCorpusTests`.
- **Engine hygiene:** Project-once Projection contract for report sections that share windows; version-strip honesty (writers must not re-emit newer-schema facts into older targets); Double-safe Projection timing composition. Tests: `FCPXMLEngineHygieneTests` (project-once, strip honesty, Complex smoke budget) + Complex projection `measure` in `FCPXMLPerformanceTests`.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **CLI output directories:** `--report`, `--convert-version`, `--media-copy`, and `--create-project` create the output directory (and intermediates) when missing, instead of failing with a confusing ZIP/save error.
- **CLI orphan options:** `--timecode-format`, `--media-resolution`, and other REPORT modifiers require `--report`; `--extension-type` requires `--convert-version`.
- **CLI `--media-resolution` values:** Raw values / help use `fail-soft` and `fail-loud` (aliases `failSoft` / `failLoud` still accepted).
- **Projection geometry:** `MediaUsageWindow` optional roles/effects/breadcrumbs (`includeAnnotations`); `expandAllSourceChannels`; `RetimingSegment.composing` through ref-clip nests; Summary `summaryOverlapAwareDurations` (union via `TimelineOccupancyIndex`, default off). Tests: `FCPXMLProjectionCoverageTests` (annotations, per-src, compose, sync-in-mc, PhotoshopSample1, overlap-aware Summary).
- **Extraction fidelity:** Markers preset filters by host-clip occlusion (keeps BasicMarkers title markers; drops Occlusion3 fully occluded hosts); Keywords use `reportMainTimelineVisible`; `ExtractedElement` / context tools honour ExtractionScope audition/MC masks for inherited roles; report Projection sets `excludeFullyOccluded` (`TimelineProjectionOptions`). Tests: `FCPXMLExtractionNestFidelityTests`, `FCPXMLRoleInheritanceMatrixTests`, `FCPXMLExtractionProjectionPolicyTests`.
- **Parsing/Model coverage:** Audio channel/role sources expose DTD playback children (volume/loudness/EQ/voice isolation, `filter-audio`, `mute`); `AnalysisMarker` + Markers extraction/report type; shared `TextStyle` XML parse/build + typed `text-style-def` accessors; `tracking-shape` attributes; Sendable `CollectionFolder.smartCollections` via `SmartCollectionValue`.
- **Report export performance / progress:** Progress pipeline includes `Projecting Timeline`, content phases, then `Saving Workbook` / `Saving PDF` (ticks after saves complete). Excel cell writes are single-pass (no setRow + recolor), column autofit uses row text instead of rescanning `sheet.cells`, projection window matching is indexed, inventory extract is shared with Summary, PDF TOC measure pass skips text drawing, and Excel+PDF export can overlap on Sendable `Report` data.

- **Test suite:** Expanded to **1076** tests listed in `swift test --list-tests` (**1072** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests`; plus **4** optional `ExcelReportTest`), including `GeneralDemo.fcpxml` / `FCPXMLFileTest_GeneralDemo`, private `Submitted FCPXML` inbox smoke test, `FCPXMLParsingCoverageTests`, extraction fidelity, `FCPXMLProjectionCoverageTests`, `FCPXMLReportObligationCorpusTests`, `FCPXMLEngineHygieneTests`, and `Text.textStyles` setter coverage.
- **Submitted FCPXML inbox:** `Tests/Submitted FCPXML/` for local private user exports (gitignored `Inbox/` / `Notes/`); workflow: anonymise → reproduce → fix → promote minimal public fixture. See `Tests/Submitted FCPXML/README.md`.
- **Documentation:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.7, `AGENT.md`, `.cursorrules`, Manual chapters, and `Tests/README.md` updated for Timeline Projection and reporting contracts.
- **Conform scaling:** Shared `fcpConformRateScalingFactor(timelineFrameRate:mediaFrameRate:)` used by parsing and Projection.
- **Projection timing safety:** `ProjectionTiming` (and identity / timeMap / J–L placement) composes timeline fractions via `Double` intermediates so mixing `conform-rate` `Fraction(double:)` values with literal FCPXML rationals does not trap on `Int` overflow (regression: `24.fcpxml`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`Text.textStyles` setter:** Updates child `text-style` elements (was incorrectly using `.text`); convenience init now applies the `textStyles` parameter. Test: `testTextTextStylesInitAndSetterReplaceTextStyleChildren`.

---

## [3.0.7](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.7) - 2026-07-15

### ✨ New Features

- **Report copyright label:** Optional ``ReportOptions/copyrightLabel`` / ``Report/copyrightLabel`` (CLI `--label-copyright`) writes Excel cover sheet cell **A2** below the Created-by brand row (same black/white banner style), shows the same line on the PDF cover below Created-by (subtitle font/size), and centres it in the PDF running footer (footer font/size). Optional `ExcelReportTest` writes `OFK-Copyright.xlsx` / `OFK-Copyright.pdf` for visual review (4 integration tests).

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Dependencies:** [SwiftExtensions](https://github.com/orchetect/swift-extensions) minimum raised to **3.0.0**. Adds [SwiftSemanticVersion](https://github.com/orchetect/swift-semantic-version) **1.0.0** for `FinalCutPro.FCPXML.Version` (`SemanticVersion` was extracted from SwiftExtensions in 3.0.0). Report formatting now uses SwiftExtensions `titleCased` instead of a local first-character-only helper. Unused `import SwiftExtensions` cleaned up; remaining imports use `internal import` (or `public import` where SE types appear in public API).
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **963** tests listed in `swift test --list-tests` (**959** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests`: 956 XCTest + 3 Swift Testing `@Test`; plus **4** optional `ExcelReportTest`).
- **Documentation:** Manual **19 — Reporting** / **16 — CLI** / **17 — Examples** / **18 — Cross-Platform**, CLI README, project README, `AGENT.md`, `.cursorrules`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§2.7 + mermaid), `Tests/README.md`, and `Tests/ExcelReportTest` READMEs updated for `--label-copyright`, dependency notes, and test counts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

---

## [3.0.6](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.6) - 2026-07-15

### ✨ New Features

- **Universal report Row column:** Excel and PDF tabular sheets (Markers, Keywords, Titles & Generators, Transitions, Video & Audio Effects, Speed Change Effects, Summary role-duration table, Media Summary, plus role inventory) include a 1-based **Row** column by default via `ReportColumnExclusion.ensuringRowColumn`. PDF multi-page / multi-column-set injection uses `allowsInjectedRowColumn` / `preparePaginatedTable(allowInjectedRowColumn:)`. CLI `--exclude-column Row` (aliases: Row Numbers, Row Number) omits Row everywhere.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Summary Excel layout:** Project title moves to **B1** so column A stays a narrow **Row** column; title column width uses a generous autofit range (`summaryProjectTitleColumnWidth`).
- **PDF cover notes:** Black “About This PDF Export” header band with white `info.circle` SF Symbol; tightened cover body copy (default Row; exclude via `--exclude-column Row`).
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **960** tests listed in `swift test --list-tests` (**957** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests`: 954 XCTest + 3 Swift Testing `@Test`; plus **3** optional `ExcelReportTest`).
- **Documentation:** Manual **19 — Reporting** / **16 — CLI**, CLI README, `AGENT.md`, `.cursorrules`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§2.7 + mermaid test counts), `Tests/README.md`, and `Tests/ExcelReportTest/README.md` updated for universal Row, Summary **B1**, PDF cover polish, and test counts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Summary Row column width:** Long project titles no longer inflate the Excel **Row** column when the title shared column A.

---

## [3.0.5](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.5) - 2026-07-14

### ✨ New Features

- **PDF TOC sheet colour chips:** Table of Contents rows show an accent-palette colour chip and a light content-tint wash keyed to each workbook sheet title’s sequential `colorIndex` (same index as per-sheet content-page tints, including role sheets via `FCPXMLReportPDFSheetPlan`).

### 🔧 Improvements

- **PDF column width fill:** After horizontal packing, remaining columns expand proportionally to fill A4 landscape `contentWidth` when leftover space remains (for example after many `excludedColumns`). Pinned **Row** columns keep their packed width; wide tables still chunk horizontally and each chunk fills the page (`FCPXMLReportPDFTableLayout`).
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **951** tests listed in `swift test --list-tests` (**948** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests`: 945 XCTest + 3 Swift Testing `@Test`; plus **3** optional `ExcelReportTest`), including `FCPXMLReportPDFTableLayoutTests`, `FCPXMLReportPDFSheetPlanTests`, and `testExportRoleInventoryPDFWithManyExcludedColumns` (`Output/OFK-ExcludedColumns.pdf`).
- **ExcelReportTest fixtures:** Preferred `Sample.fcpxmld` / `Sample.fcpxml` resolution also checks under `Output/`; auto-discovery falls back there as well.
- **Documentation:** Manual **19 — Reporting** / **16 — CLI**, CLI README, `AGENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§2.7 PDF presentation + mermaid), `.cursorrules`, `Tests/README.md`, and `Tests/ExcelReportTest/README.md` updated for TOC colour chips, column-width expansion, and test counts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **PDF tables after column exclusion:** Tables with few remaining columns no longer left a large empty band on the right of the page; leftover horizontal space is redistributed so columns fill the usable content width.

---

## [3.0.4](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.4) - 2026-07-13

### ✨ New Features

- **PDF report export:** `FinalCutPro.FCPXML.ReportPDFExport` (`makePDFData(from:)`, `export(_:to:)`) renders a built `Report` to a multi-page `.pdf` via CoreGraphics. All nine workbook sections are supported (Selected Roles Inventory, per-role sheets, Markers, Keywords, Titles & Generators, Transitions, Video & Audio Effects, Speed Change Effects, Summary, Media Summary) with dynamic column widths, pagination, and truncation for wide tables.
- **PDF presentation:** Cover page with workbook branding (`ReportWorkbookCoverSheet` / `exportBrandingText`), dynamic table of contents (section titles and page numbers), per-page header/footer rules, and section background tinting between header and footer bands.
- **CLI `--create-pdf`:** With `--report`, also writes `{project-or-clip-name}.pdf` beside the `.xlsx` workbook from the same built `Report`. Section flags, `--exclude-column`, `--exclude-role`, `--exclude-disabled-clips`, `--timecode-format`, and `--report-project` apply to both formats. Progress includes a **Saving PDF** step when enabled.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Shared row colours:** Excel and PDF export now use `FCPXMLReportRowColorPolicy` for inventory, section-sheet, Summary, and Media Summary text colours (refactored from `FCPXMLReportWorkbookExporter`).
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **944** tests listed in `swift test --list-tests` (**942** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests`: 939 XCTest + 3 Swift Testing `@Test`; plus **2** optional `ExcelReportTest`), including `FCPXMLReportPDFExportTests` (cover, TOC, section parity, pagination, branding), `testExportDefaultRoleInventoryPDF` integration coverage, and strengthened `FCPXMLCompoundClipReportTests` / `FCPXMLReportTimecodeFormatTests` regression assertions.
- **CLI help:** `--help` overview and REPORT option strings now describe Excel/PDF report export consistently (`--create-pdf`, `--timecode-format`, `--exclude-column`, `--report-project`).
- **Dependencies:** SwiftExtensions minimum raised to **2.3.2**.
- **Documentation:** Manual chapter **19 — Reporting, Excel & PDF Export**; updated **16 — CLI**, **17 — Examples**, and cross-platform notes; CLI README; `AGENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§2.7 / §8), `.cursorrules`; and `Tests/README.md` / `Tests/ExcelReportTest/README.md`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

---

## [3.0.3](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.3) - 2026-07-10

### ✨ New Features

- **Compound-clip Excel reports:** `FinalCutPro.FCPXML.allReportTimelineSources()` discovers both project sequences and standalone compound-clip timelines (event-level `ref-clip` → `media`/`sequence`). `ReportBuilder` / `buildReport` and Summary use this so FCP “Export XML” of a compound clip (no `<project>`) produces role inventory, markers, and other sheets like a normal project.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Test suite:** Expanded to **933** tests (**932** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests` + **1** optional `ExcelReportTest`), including `FCPXMLCompoundClipReportTests`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Report timeline resolution:** Documents that contain only an event-level compound clip no longer fail with `ReportError.noProjectsFound`; reporting walks the compound clip’s `media` sequence instead.

---

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.2) - 2026-07-08

### ✨ New Features

- **Configurable report timecode formats:** `ReportOptions.timecodeFormat` / `Report.timecodeFormat` (`ReportTimecodeFormat`) control timeline time cells across all report sheets. Modes: `.smpteFrames` (`HH:MM:SS:FF`, default), `.frames` (`Frames`), `.feetAndFrames` (`Feet+Frames`), and `.smpteNoFrames` (`HH:MM:SS`). CLI `--timecode-format` accepts the same values.
- **Format-aware column headers:** Timecode columns use dynamic suffixes in Excel (e.g. `Timeline In (frames)`); `ReportColumn` exclusion matches both plain and suffixed headers.
- **Shared build / progress order:** `ReportBuildPhase.enabledPhases(for:)` is the single source of truth for inventory-first product order (Selected Roles Inventory → Markers → … → Media Summary). `ReportBuilder`, CLI progress, and GUI `onPhaseStarted` callbacks share the same phase list.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Timeline string formatting:** Report SMPTE cells use SwiftTimecode `stringValue()` so non-drop-frame uses `:` and drop-frame uses `;` before frames.
- **Sort guardrails:** Timeline position sorting is numeric for Frames and Feet+Frames (avoids lexicographic order issues such as `100` before `20`).
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **925** tests (**924** in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests` + **1** optional `ExcelReportTest`), including `FCPXMLReportTimecodeFormatTests` and `FCPXMLReportBuildPhaseTests`, plus format-aware header and numeric-sort coverage in formatting/column-exclusion tests.
- **Documentation:** Updated manual chapters **16 — CLI**, **17 — Examples**, and **19 — Reporting & Excel Export**; CLI README; project README; `AGENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§2.7 / §3), `.cursorrules`; and `Tests/README.md` / `Tests/ExcelReportTest/README.md`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Drop-frame notation:** SMPTE report cells for drop-frame rates (e.g. 29.97 DF) now correctly use semicolon separators instead of always formatting as non-drop-frame.
- **Build progress order:** Report build and progress callbacks no longer finish inventory after optional sheets; phases now match the GUI / workbook product order (Selected Roles Inventory first).

---

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.1) - 2026-07-07

### ✨ New Features

- **Media Summary sheet:** Split missing-media reporting out of Summary into a dedicated **Media Summary** sheet. `ReportOptions.includeMediaSummary`, `.mediaSummaryOnly`, and CLI `--report-media-summary` (included in `--report-full`).
- **Global column exclusion:** `ReportOptions.excludedColumns` and `ReportColumn` omit named columns from every applicable workbook sheet at export. CLI `--exclude-column` (repeatable; case-insensitive aliases such as `Metadata`, `Row Numbers`, `Source File Path`).
- **Disabled-clip filtering:** `ReportOptions.excludeDisabledClips` and CLI `--exclude-disabled-clips` omit `enabled="0"` clips from all timeline-based report sections (role inventory, markers, keywords, titles, transitions, effects, speed-change effects, summary role durations).
- **Expanded role inventory columns:** **Selected Roles Inventory** and per-role sheets now use a shared 32-column layout (`RoleInventoryColumnLayout`): Row index, 23 fixed columns (including Take, Camera Angle/Name, Frame Rate/Sample Rate, Frame Size, Source File Name/Path), plus sorted dynamic metadata key columns.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Sheet naming:** Main role inventory tab renamed to **Selected Roles Inventory**; workbook sheet titles use Title Case.
- **Excel export:** Improved column auto-fit (wider maximum and header-based minimum widths for path columns); `Report.excludedColumns` resolved at build time and applied across inventory, section sheets, summary metrics, and media summary. **`FCPXMLReportWorkbookExporter`** applies sheet-specific row text colours via `RoleRowColorContext`: inventory rows tinted by role category (video/caption blue, titles purple, audio green, gap gray); Keywords, Titles & Generators, Effects, Speed Change Effects, and Transitions use dedicated rules when Category is unavailable; Summary project title uses the table header style with black data rows; Media Summary missing paths use red text; Markers retain marker-type colours.
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **894** tests (893 in `OpenFCPXMLKitTests` + 1 optional `ExcelReportTest` integration), including `FCPXMLRoleInventoryColumnLayoutTests`, `FCPXMLReportColumnExclusionTests`, `FCPXMLReportExcludeDisabledClipsTests`, and `FCPXMLReportExcelExportTests` (workbook cell formatting: Summary title header, black role-duration data, red missing-media paths, inventory/section-sheet colour rules).
- **Documentation:** Updated manual chapters **16 — CLI** and **19 — Reporting & Excel Export** (workbook cell colour policy), CLI README, project README, `AGENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (§2.7 reporting layers, top-down Mermaid diagrams), `.cursorrules`, and `Tests/README.md` / `Tests/ExcelReportTest/README.md`.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Summary sheet formatting:** Role-duration rows and **% of Total** no longer incorrectly tinted with role colours; data uses default black text. Project title row (row 1) now uses the table header style (bold white text on black fill).
- **Section sheet row colours:** Keywords, Titles & Generators, Effects, Speed Change Effects, and Transitions no longer default to green when the Category column is absent; each sheet now applies its documented colour rules.
- **Media Summary:** Missing media file paths now render in red (`#FF0000`).
- **Gap role colour:** Inventory gap rows use gray (`#808080`) instead of black.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/3.0.0) - 2026-07-02

### ✨ New Features

- **Project renamed to OpenFCPXMLKit:** Pipeline Neo is now **OpenFCPXMLKit**. All code, APIs, documentation, and tooling use OpenFCPXMLKit naming exclusively — the `OpenFCPXMLKit` module, the `OpenFCPXMLKit-CLI` binary, and the `OFKXML*` cross-platform XML types. Existing FCPXML parsing, creation, and manipulation APIs remain source-compatible; the product name and module are what changed.
- **Production's Best Friend–style Excel reports:** A new reporting subsystem builds structured, multi-sheet `.xlsx` workbooks from an FCPXML/FCPXMLD, modelled on Production's Best Friend report layouts. Sheets include **Role Inventory** (Selected Roles plus per-role sheets), **Markers**, **Keywords**, **Titles & Generators**, **Transitions**, **Video & Audio Effects**, **Speed Change Effects**, and a **Summary** sheet with per-role duration totals and percentages. Workbook export is XLKit-backed with Production's Best Friend–style formatting (black header rows, role and marker colour coding, numeric percentage cells, column auto-fit).
- **Reporting API:** `FinalCutPro.FCPXML.buildReport(options:)` with `ReportBuilder`, typed `Report`/section/row models, and `ReportOptions` presets (`.full`, `.markersOnly`, `.roleInventoryOnly`, `.summaryOnly`, and more), plus role exclusions, project-name filtering, progress callbacks, and `RoleDisplayPreference`. `ReportExcelExport` renders any `Report` to a workbook or writes it to an `.xlsx` file.
- **CLI `--report`:** New REPORT command on **OpenFCPXMLKit-CLI**. `--report` alone exports the role inventory; `--report-full` adds every optional sheet; per-section flags (`--report-markers`, `--report-keywords`, `--report-titles-generators`, `--report-transitions`, `--report-effects`, `--report-speed-change-effects`, `--report-summary`) select individual sheets, and `--exclude-role` / `--report-project` refine the output. Writes `{project-name}.xlsx` to the output directory.
- **Extraction presets:** Added `TitlesExtractionPreset` and `EffectsExtractionPreset` alongside the existing presets to drive report-oriented element extraction.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Dependencies:** Added **XLKit** for Excel workbook generation (`Reporting/Excel`).
- **Test suite:** Expanded to **877 tests** with dedicated reporting and extraction coverage (role inventory, markers, keywords, titles, transitions, effects, speed-change effects, summary, Excel export, role display/exclusion, and extraction scope/presets). Test files and classes are standardised on the **`FCPXML`** prefix, with the module-named umbrella `OpenFCPXMLKitTests` as the sole exception.
- **Documentation:** New manual chapter **19 — Reporting & Excel Export**; updated CLI and Extraction chapters, the manual index/README, and examples. `AGENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.cursorrules`, and `Tests/README.md` updated for the reporting subsystem, OpenFCPXMLKit naming, and the standardised `FCPXML`-prefixed test naming.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

## [2.5.2](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.5.2) - 2026-03-27

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Timeline test availability wording:** Clarified `TimelineManipulationTests` availability comments to state behavior consistency across all supported macOS versions (12.0 and later), removing ambiguous minor-version phrasing.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Offset helper naming correctness:** In `FCPXMLElementOffset`, renamed a misleading local variable (`dur`) to `offset` in `_fcpOffsetAsTimecode`, aligning naming with actual semantics and reducing maintenance confusion.
- **Timestamp test redundancy removal:** Removed a redundant tolerance assertion in `testTimelineTimestampsInitialization` now that both timestamps are intentionally injected with the same baseline value.

---

## [2.5.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.5.1) - 2026-03-21

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Timeline API documentation:** Clarified `Timeline.insertingClipWithRipple` behavior to explicitly state that clips overlapping the insertion point but starting before it are not shifted.
- **Timeline test coverage clarity:** `TimelineManipulationTests` now includes explicit availability context for `@available(macOS 12.0, *)` and stronger comments describing ripple and lane-selection semantics.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Deterministic lane-selection assertions:** Updated `TimelineManipulationTests` to assert exact lane outcomes for outward lane search and multi-conflict auto-lane placement, preventing ambiguous assertions from masking behavior changes.
- **Timestamp test stability:** Reworked `testTimelineTimestampsInitialization` to use fixed injected timestamps instead of real-time clock comparisons, removing race-prone timing assertions.

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.5.0) - 2026-03-16

### ✨ New Features

- **Cross-platform XML abstraction layer — iOS support (PR [#17](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/pull/17)):** Pipeline Neo can now target **iOS 15+** in addition to macOS. A protocol-based XML layer decouples the library from Foundation’s DOM API (macOS-only) and adds an AEXML-backed implementation for non-macOS platforms. Thanks @stovak!
- **New `Sources/PipelineNeo/XML/`:** Protocols `PNXMLNode`, `PNXMLElement`, `PNXMLDocument`, `PNXMLDTDProtocol`, `PNXMLFactory`; Foundation backend on macOS (byte-identical behavior); AEXML backend for iOS and other platforms; `PNXMLDefaultFactory()` for platform dispatch.
- **DTD validation:** On macOS, full DTD validation is unchanged. On iOS, **FCPXMLStructuralValidator** performs cross-platform structural validation (root element, required children, element allowlist, required attributes) when Foundation DTD is unavailable.
- **Package.swift:** `.iOS(.v15)` added to platforms; **AEXML** added as a dependency.
- **Backwards compatibility:** macOS behavior is unchanged; existing APIs remain source-compatible.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Test suite:** Expanded to **686 tests**. Added `AEXMLSerializationParityTests` (AEXML round-trip and backend parity), `FCPXMLDTDValidatorTests` (platform-conditional DTD vs structural fallback), `FCPXMLStructuralValidatorTests` (cross-platform structural validation), and `ImportOptionsTests`. Updated `Tests/README.md` with current structure tree, categories, and coverage.
- **Documentation:** New manual chapter **18 — Cross-Platform & iOS**; updated Overview, Loading/Parsing, Validation, XML Extensions, and Documentation README. Aligned `AGENT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `.cursorrules` with cross-platform XML layer, iOS support, 686 tests, and `FCPXMLStructuralValidator` / PNXML naming.
- **CI:** New iOS Simulator build job.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **`removeChildren(where:)` index mismatch (PR [#17](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/pull/17)):** The default implementation previously used indices from `childElements` (elements only) when calling `removeChild(at:)` on the full `children` array (including text nodes), removing the wrong nodes when text/whitespace was present. It now iterates the full `children` array so indices match. Fixes failures in ImportOptionsTests and EventClips removal.

---

## [2.4.3](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.4.3) - 2026-03-07

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Documentation alignment:** Normalized `AGENT.md` and `.cursorrules` so both files reflect the same architecture guidance, section coverage, and documentation-sync checklist terminology.
- **CLI documentation:** Updated `Sources/PipelineNeoCLI/README.md` and manual pages (`Documentation/Manual/16-CLI.md`, `Documentation/Manual/17-Examples.md`) to use `--project-version` for create-project examples and option descriptions.
- **Test consistency:** Updated `TimelineManipulationTests.testTimelineModifiedAtUpdatesOnAutoLaneInsert` to remove an unnecessary `throws` signature and use explicit `do/catch` + `XCTFail` for clearer failure reporting.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Xcode 26 dynamic linking compatibility (PR #16):** Added `swift-log` as an explicit package dependency and `Logging` as a direct target dependency in `Package.swift` to resolve undefined `Logging.Logger` symbols when building Pipeline Neo as a dynamic framework under Xcode 26's stricter transitive dependency linking rules. Thanks @stovak!
- **CLI `--version` conflict:** Resolved option-name collision between the built-in `--version` flag and create-project's timeline version option by renaming the create-project option from `--version` to `--project-version`. `pipeline-neo --version` now correctly prints the CLI tool version.

---

## [2.4.2](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.4.2) - 2026-03-06

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Test quality:** Cleaned up `TimelineManipulationTests` by removing an unnecessary `throws` from `testTimelineModifiedAtUpdatesOnRippleInsert`, aligning the signature with actual non-throwing behavior and reducing static analysis noise.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

---

## [2.4.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.4.1) - 2026-03-02

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Test suite:** Expanded to **655 tests**. Added in TimelineExportValidationTests: testFCPXMLExporterExportsClipMarkers, testFCPXMLExporterExportsClipChapterMarkers, testFCPXMLExporterExportsClipKeywords, testFCPXMLExporterExportsClipRatings, testFCPXMLExporterExportsClipMetadata, testFCPXMLExporterClipMetadataAllTypesValidatesAgainstDTD (export with all metadata types then DTD validate), testFCPXMLExporterXmlDeclarationStandaloneNo (assert exported XML uses standalone="no" for DTD/xmllint compatibility).
- **PR #14 (clip-level metadata export):** Test coverage for FCPXMLExporter exporting clip-level metadata (markers, chapter-markers, keywords, ratings, custom metadata) as children of `<asset-clip>` per FCPXML DTD; tests in TimelineExportValidationTests; Tests/README.md updated with coverage and XML declaration standalone note. Thanks @stovak!
- **TimelineManipulationTests:** Addressed GitHub Code Scan findings: replaced actor-based `NowBox` + `DispatchSemaphore` with a lock-based class (`NSLock`) to avoid thread exhaustion and deadlock risk when providing injectable "now" in timestamp tests; replaced `XCTAssertNoThrow` with do-catch and non-optional bindings for `insertClipAutoLane` and `insertingClipAutoLane` to properly verify success and handle thrown errors.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **xmllint / DTD validation:** Resolved "standalone" warnings when validating exported FCPXML with `xmllint --dtdvalid`. XML declaration now outputs `standalone="no"` instead of removing the attribute, so libxml2 treats the document as dependent on an external DTD and no longer warns about whitespace nodes from pretty-printing. Change in XMLDocumentExtension.fcpxmlString.

---

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.4.0) - 2026-02-23

### ✨ New Features

- **CLI `--create-project`:** Create a new empty FCPXML project from the command line. Under the TIMELINE section: `--create-project` with `--width`, `--height`, `--rate`, optional `--version` (default 1.14), and a single positional output directory. Project name is derived from format (e.g. `1920x1080@25p`). Mandatory DTD validation after build and before write; FCP-style output with DOCTYPE, format `colorSpace`, and optional default smart collections. Logging options (`--log`, `--log-level`, `--quiet`) apply to create-project output.
- **FCPXMLExporter:** New `includeDefaultSmartCollections` parameter (default `false`). When `true`, adds five FCP-style default smart collections under the library (Projects, All Video, Audio Only, Stills, Favorites). Exported document includes DOCTYPE; format elements always include `name` and `colorSpace` for compatibility with Final Cut Pro.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Test suite:** Expanded to **648 tests**. Added `testEmptyTimelineCreationAtDifferentSizesAndFrameRates` (barebone empty `Timeline` at multiple sizes and frame rates: 720p, 1080p, 4K UHD, DCI 4K, custom 640×480; asserts name, clips, duration, format, aspectRatio). Added `testProjectCreationStyleExportValidatesAgainstDTD` (empty timeline export with `includeDefaultSmartCollections`, parse, and DTD validation). Added `testProjectCreationAtDifferentSizesAndFrameRates` (export at multiple sizes and frame rates, then parse and validate against DTD).
- **Documentation:** Updated `.cursorrules`, `AGENT.md`, `Tests/README.md`, and `README.md` with CLI create-project, test count 648, and empty timeline / project-creation test coverage. Manual (Timeline & Export, CLI, Examples) and `Sources/PipelineNeoCLI/README.md` updated for create-project usage and TIMELINE options.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **FCP import:** Resolved "No declaration for attribute name of element library" by no longer writing a `name` attribute on the `library` element (FCPXML DTD allows only `location` and `colorProcessing`).
- **FCP import:** Resolved "unexpected value" for `format="r1"` by always writing a format `name` (e.g. `FFVideoFormatRateUndefined` for custom dimensions) and `colorSpace` on format elements in exported FCPXML.

## [2.3.1](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.3.1) - 2026-02-18

### ✨ New Features

- None in this release.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Test suite:** Expanded to **638 tests** (from 587). Added comprehensive file tests for new FCPXML samples: `FCPXMLFileTest_360Video` (360 video features, color conform, bookmarks, smart collections), `FCPXMLFileTest_AuditionSample` (audition elements, conform-rate, keywords), `FCPXMLFileTest_ImageSample` (still image assets), `FCPXMLFileTest_Multicam` (multicam resources and clips), `FCPXMLFileTest_Photoshop` (Photoshop-specific FCPXML), `FCPXMLFileTest_SmartCollection` (smart collection parsing across multiple samples with match-clip, match-media, match-ratings). Updated existing file tests: `FCPXMLFileTest_CompoundClips` (CompoundClipSample), `FCPXMLFileTest_Keywords` (EventsWithKeywords, KeywordsWithinFolders), `CaptionTitleTests` (CaptionSample), `TimelineManipulationTests` (TimelineSample, TimelineWithSecondaryStoryline, TimelineWithSecondaryStorylineWithAudioKeyframes), `CutDetectionTests` (CutSample).
- **Audio keyframe tests:** Added `AudioKeyframeTests` (10 tests) for comprehensive audio keyframe validation: parsing `adjust-volume > param name="amount" > keyframeAnimation > keyframe` structures from FCPXML samples; decibel value validation (-3dB, -37dB format); time value validation (FCPXML fractional format); fadeIn/fadeOut integration; multiple keyframes in sequence; secondary storyline and nested clip detection. File tests: `TimelineWithSecondaryStorylineWithAudioKeyframes`, `TimelineSample`.
- **FCPXML samples:** Added 15 new sample files covering 360 video, auditions, conform-rate, still images, multicam, secondary storylines, audio keyframes, keyword collections/folders, and Photoshop integration. All samples verified for parsing and feature extraction.
- **Documentation:** Updated `Tests/README.md` with new test files (including `AudioKeyframeTests`), expanded file tests table, updated test count to 638, and enhanced scope description to include new FCPXML features tested.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None in this release.

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.3.0) - 2026-02-16

### ✨ New Features

- **Live Drawing (FCPXML 1.11+):** Typed `LiveDrawing` model for the `live-drawing` story element (drawn/sketch content). Attributes: `role`, `dataLocator`, `animationType`; conforms to `FCPXMLElementClipAttributes` and `FCPXMLElementMetaTimeline`. Wired into `allTimelineCases`, `FCPXMLAnyTimeline` (`.liveDrawing(LiveDrawing)`), and `ElementModelType` / `AnyElementModelType`. Tests in APIAndEdgeCaseTests (init, attributes, AnyTimeline round-trip).
- **HiddenClipMarker (FCPXML 1.13+):** Typed `HiddenClipMarker` model (empty marker element). Included in `fcpxAnnotations` and `addToClip(annotationElements:)`. Version converter strips `hidden-clip-marker` when converting to &lt; 1.13. Tests in APIAndEdgeCaseTests and VersionConversionTests.
- **Format and Asset 1.13+:** Format `heroEye` (left | right) and Asset `heroEyeOverride`, `mediaReps` (multiple `media-rep`) with get/set, inits, and round-trip. Version converter strips `heroEye`/`heroEyeOverride` when converting to &lt; 1.13. Tests in FCPXMLFormatAssetTests and VersionConversionTests.
- **SmartCollection match rules:** Typed models and SmartCollection properties for `MatchUsage` (1.9+), `MatchRepresentation`, `MatchMarkers` (1.10+), `MatchAnalysisType` (1.14). Round-trip and version stripping. Tests in SmartCollectionTests.
- **Additional typed adjustments and Clip integration:** `ReorientAdjustment`, `OrientationAdjustment` (1.7+), `CinematicAdjustment` (1.10+), `ColorConformAdjustment` (1.11+), `Stereo3DAdjustment` (1.13+), `VoiceIsolationAdjustment` (1.14), `ConformAdjustment`, `RollingShutterAdjustment` with Clip accessors (`reorientAdjustment`, `orientationAdjustment`, `cinematicAdjustment`, `colorConformAdjustment`, `stereo3DAdjustment`, `voiceIsolationAdjustment`, `conformAdjustment`, `rollingShutterAdjustment`). Tests in AdjustmentTests.
- **FilterParameter and Keyframe auxValue (1.11+):** `FilterParameter` and `Keyframe` support `auxValue`; version converter strips param `auxValue` when target DTD does not include it. Tests in FilterTests.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Version conversion:** `FCPXMLVersionConverter` uses DTD-derived allowlists (`FCPXMLDTDAllowlistGenerator.allowlist(fromDTDContent:)`) for element and attribute stripping; `EmbeddedDTDProvider` for CLI. Fallback to hand-maintained lists when DTD unavailable.
- **Documentation:** Manual restructured into chapter-based layout. New `Documentation/Manual/` with 18 files: 00-Index (table of contents), 01–17 covering Overview, Loading & Parsing, Timecode, Pipeline & Logging, Validation & Cut Detection, Version Conversion & Export, Timeline & Export, Timeline Manipulation, Timeline Metadata, Extraction & Media, Media Processing, Typed Models, XML Extensions, High-Level Model, Errors & Utilities, CLI, and Examples. `Documentation/README.md` updated with manual index and chapter links. Root `Documentation/Manual.md` now redirects to the structured manual.
- **Documentation:** Typed Models chapter (12) documents Live Drawing, HiddenClipMarker, Format/Asset 1.13+, SmartCollection match rules, and all adjustment/filter/caption/keyframe/collection models with examples.
- **Tests:** `Tests/README.md` reorganized with clear sections: table of contents by category (Structure & running, Coverage, Reference, Contributing & troubleshooting), test structure tree, shared utilities summary, tables for PipelineNeoTests MARK categories and for file tests (class | sample | asserts), and dedicated test files grouped by theme. Test count updated to **587 tests**. Added FCPXMLFormatAssetTests (LogicAndParsing).
- **Project rules:** `.cursorrules` and `AGENT.md` updated (backward compatibility note, Changelog section with styling: version links to release tags, ✨ New Features / 🔧 Improvements / 🐛 Bug Fixes).
- **FCPXMLClip+Adjustments:** Attribute names (e.g. `amount`, `enabled`, `type`) centralized in a private `AttributeName` enum to avoid typos and improve maintainability.
- **FCPXMLTitle+Typed:** Simplified optional-bold/italic/underline assignment from `condition ? true : nil` to `if condition { textStyle.property = true }` for clarity.
- **MediaRep:** Conforms to `@unchecked Sendable` for concurrent usage; bookmark child documented (single `bookmark` element for security-scoped bookmark data).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Gap `lane` setter:** Replaced `assertionFailure` with a no-op so setting `lane` on a gap clip no longer risks a crash in production.
- **MediaRep:** Added `FCPXMLElement` conformance so `_isElementTypeSupported` is correctly available and the type is consistent with other element models.
- **MediaRep init(bookmark: String):** Uses lossy UTF-8 encoding so the string-to-data conversion cannot fail silently by returning `nil`.

---

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/TheAcharya/OpenFCPXMLKit/releases/tag/2.2.0) - 2026-02-14

- **Transform360:** `Transform360Adjustment` model for 360° video (coordinate types spherical/cartesian, position/orientation, auto-orient, convergence, interaxial) with `Clip` integration.
- **Typed filter models:** `VideoFilter`, `AudioFilter`, `VideoFilterMask`, `FilterParameter` with keyframe animation support (`FadeIn`, `FadeOut`, `KeyframeAnimation`).
- **Caption and Title models:** `Caption` and `Title` with `TextStyle` and `TextStyleDefinition` for rich text formatting (font, fontSize, textAlignment, etc.).
- **Keyframe animation:** `KeyframeAnimation`, `Keyframe` (interpolation types), `FadeIn`/`FadeOut` (fade types), integrated with `FilterParameter`.
- **CMTime Codable:** Direct `CMTime` encoding/decoding as FCPXML time strings (`"value/timescale"s` format).
- **Collection organization:** `CollectionFolder` and `KeywordCollection` models for organizing clips and media with nested folder structures.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **CutDetector:** Edit type classification for non-adjacent clips now prioritizes transitions over gaps when multiple elements exist between clips.
- **XMLElementExtension:** Synchronized clip matching fixed to prevent duplicate entries when multiple nested children match the same resource.
- **XMLElementExtension:** Compound clip traversal fixed to properly check secondary storylines (spine elements) for matching resources.
- **XMLElementExtension:** `childElementsWithinRangeOf` now explicitly handles elements with missing timing attributes (`fcpxOffset`/`fcpxDuration`).
- **MediaExtractor:** URL resolution documentation enhanced for `nil` URLs and non-file URLs (automatically skipped during copy).
- **FCPXMLVersionConverter:** Explicit error handling for edge case where `rootElement()` returns `nil` during version conversion (debug assertion in development builds).
- **FCPXMLUtility:** Added validation methods `validateDocumentAgainstDTD`, `validateDocumentAgainstDeclaredVersion`, `performValidation` for API parity with `FCPXMLService` (sync and async).
- **FCPXMLUtility:** Added `filterElements(_:ofTypes:)` alias for API consistency with `FCPXMLService`.
- **ModularUtilities:** Validator instance creation optimized using a shared static validator instance.
- **FCPXMLUtility:** Refactored deprecated project time conversion methods (`projectTimecode`, `projectCounterTime`) to delegate to sequence methods, removing duplication.
- **FCPXMLService / FCPXMLUtility:** Async validation method documentation improved (CPU-bound behavior, non-Sendable type constraints).
- **ProgressBar:** Thread safety documentation enhanced with usage guidelines.
- **ProgressReporter:** Protocol documentation clarified for thread safety expectations.
- **Test suite:** Expanded to 535 tests; added AdjustmentTests, AudioEnhancementTests, Transform360Tests, CaptionTitleTests, KeyframeAnimationTests, CMTimeCodableTests, CollectionTests, FilterTests, CodableTests, ImportOptionsTests, SmartCollectionTests.
- **Documentation:** AGENT.md, .cursorrules, Tests/README.md, README.md, Documentation/Manual.md, and Documentation/README.md updated for new features and test count.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- None explicitly called out in this release (improvements above include behavioral fixes in CutDetector and XMLElementExtension).

- **Silence detection:** `SilenceDetection` protocol (silence at start/end of audio; threshold, minimum duration).
- **Asset duration measurement:** `AssetDurationMeasurement` protocol (actual duration from AVFoundation for audio/video/images).
- **Parallel file I/O:** `ParallelFileIO` protocol for concurrent read/write operations.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **TimelineFormat:** Presets (hd720p, dci4K, hd1080i, hd720i); computed properties (aspectRatio, isHD, isUHD, isDCI4K, isStandard4K, is1080p, is720p, interlaced).
- **TimelineError:** New cases `assetNotFound`, `invalidFormat`, `invalidAssetReference`.
- **Test suite:** Expanded to 320 tests (TimelineManipulationTests, FCPXMLTimecodeTests, MIMETypeDetectionTests, AssetValidationTests, SilenceDetectionTests, AssetDurationMeasurementTests, ParallelFileIOTests).
- **CI:** Added CodeQL workflow.
- **Documentation:** Manual.md and Tests README updated with new APIs and examples.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
